### Resonite Cache Cleaner

--The Application can clear your Resonite Cache when you want. This makes it easy for people who don't know how to find the Cache for Resonite and clean it.
Resonite (as far as we know), does not self-clean, so this makes it a great alternative to doing it with a tool!--

This cleaner tool has been reported broken due to how Resonite now manages Cache via a DataBase file, Im unsure if this is a permanent change, but I will fix this eventually, or archive the project.

For more information on Resonite's Cache, and custom locations for it, please visit their [Docs](https://wiki.resonite.com/Relocate_Resonite_Folders)
