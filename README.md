### Resonite Cache Cleaner

The Application can clear your Resonite Cache when you want. This makes it easy for people who don't know how to find the Cache for Resonite and clean it.
Resonite (as far as we know), does not self-clean, so this makes it a great alternative to doing it with a tool!

For more information on Resonite's Cache, and custom locations for it, please visit their [Docs](https://wiki.resonite.com/Relocate_Resonite_Folders)
